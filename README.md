## Autonomous Driving Simulation
# OverView
This project implements an autonomous driving simulation using the Udacity car simulator, Flask, and machine learning models trained in Google Colab. The system collects driving data, processes it using deep learning models, and controls the vehicle in the simulator.

# Features

Real-time autonomous driving in the Udacity simulator

Flask API for communication between the simulator and the ML model

Data collection and preprocessing for training

Deep learning-based self-driving model (trained in Google Colab)
